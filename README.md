Overview : 
 CoinLeaf is a secure, responsive micro-task and earning platform where users can complete small jobs — like submissions, verifications, or content-based tasks — and earn digital coins. Whether you're a task buyer or a worker, CoinLeaf offers a smooth and user-friendly experience with personalized dashboards, real-time earnings tracking, and built-in notification and approval systems. Perfect for students, freelancers, or anyone looking to monetize their spare time.


key features : 
 1.Role-Based Platform: Supports 3 distinct roles — Worker, Buyer, and Admin, each with unique dashboards and permissions.

 2.Secure Authentication: Registration with role selection (Worker or Buyer) and Google Sign-In. Workers get 10 coins, Buyers get 50 coins on registration.

 3.Dynamic Homepage: Engaging hero slider, animated sections, best workers showcase, testimonials, and 3 custom sections to highlight platform benefits.

 4.Responsive Dashboard: Separate dashboards for Worker, Buyer, and Admin — fully responsive for mobile, tablet, and desktop views.

 5.Task Marketplace: Buyers can create, manage, and review tasks; Workers can browse tasks, submit proof, and earn coins.

 6.Earning & Withdrawal: Workers earn coins for approved tasks and can withdraw when they reach a minimum threshold (e.g., 20 coins = 1 USD, minimum 200 coins).

 7.Payment System: Buyers can purchase coins through a Stripe payment integration; all payment histories are tracked.

 8.Notification System: Real-time notifications for submissions, approvals, rejections, and withdrawals. Floating popup with actionable routes.

 9.Admin Control: Admin can manage users, tasks, and withdrawal requests; update roles, approve/reject requests, and ensure platform integrity.

 10.Image Upload & Preview: Users can upload profile photos and task images using imgBB, with live previews before submitting.

 11.Secure API & Role-Based Access: Protected routes using JWT with proper status codes (401, 403) for unauthorized access.

 12.Pagination & Search: Paginated submissions for Workers; search & filter tasks for better usability.

 13.Persistent Sessions: Private routes stay protected and don’t redirect on page reload — keeps users logged in securely.

 14.Real-Time Dashboard States: Dynamic stats for Workers, Buyers, and Admins (coins, tasks, submissions, payments).

 15.Task Detail Page: Workers can view full task info, deadlines, and clear instructions before submitting proof.

 16.Submission Management: Buyers can easily review submissions, approve/reject them, and see all relevant info in modals.

 17.Refill Logic: Coins are returned to buyers if tasks are deleted before completion — fair and transparent system.

 18.Withdrawal Requests: Workers can request cash-out via multiple payment gateways (Bkash, Nagad, Rocket).

 19.Notification Pop-Up: Interactive pop-up for real-time notifications — automatically hides when clicked outside.

 20.Advanced Table Views: Clean, sortable tables for tasks, submissions, withdrawals, and payments.

 21.Form Validations: Robust client-side and server-side validation for registration, login, tasks, and withdrawals.

 22.Developer-Friendly: Well-commented, modular code structure with reusable components and hooks.

 23.Persistent Auth: Private routes stay logged in even after page refresh; uses Firebase and secure environment variables for sensitive data.

 24.Modern Tech Stack: Fully built with MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), React Query, Tailwind CSS, Swiper Slider, and more.
